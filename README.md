# identity-api

ASP.NET Core api that provides authentification based on Identity nuget and Dapper.

# Use cases

+ You're using a RDBMS that isn't supported by EF Core.
+ You don't want to use EF Core, or you had already made a set of investment on other ORM solution.
+ You need a kick start on how to implement manually Identity stores so you can leverage it independently from actual providers.
